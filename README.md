**Data Analytics**

In this section, we dive into the realm of data analytics to gain valuable insights into the IMDB Movies Dataset. The initial general analysis covers various aspects such as total movies, budgets, gross earnings, total actors, likes, and reviews.

- **Movie Genre Analysis**: Explore the distribution of movie genres and their impact on IMDB scores. Determine the most common movie genres in the dataset. For each popular genre, calculate descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, range, variance, standard deviation) of IMDB scores.

- **Movie Duration Analysis**: Analyze the distribution of movie durations and their impact on IMDB scores. Examine the distribution of movie durations. Identify the relationship between movie duration and IMDB scores. Calculate descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, range, variance, standard deviation) of IMDB scores.

- **Language Analysis**: Examine the distribution of movies based on language. Determine the most common languages used in movies. Analyze the impact of language on IMDB scores using descriptive statistics.

- **Director Analysis**: Explore the influence of directors on movie ratings. Identify top directors based on their average IMDB scores. Analyze the contribution of directors to the success of movies. Calculate descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, range, variance, standard deviation) of IMDB scores.

- **Budget Analysis**: Explore the relationship between movie budgets and financial success. Analyze the correlation between movie budgets and gross earnings. Identify movies with the highest profit margin.
